## Initial-solution instructions

The candidate must fix the exact meaning of complement, prove how the ambient
property reaches arbitrary composition factors, and not infer the answer from
the stronger Hall-maximal hypothesis. It must reproduce the known simple list
\(L_2(7),L_2(11),L_5(2)\), handle split and nonsplit extensions, and give
explicit complement or non-complement evidence for every finite certificate.

## Four review rounds

1. **Structural:** attack quotient inheritance, Frattini reductions, direct
   products, and every primitive/monolithic transition.
2. **Extension/classification:** independently check cohomology claims,
   complement existence versus conjugacy, and all simple-family sources.
3. **Computation:** require exhaustive candidate-complement coverage or a
   mathematically complete nonexistence certificate; rerun in isolation.
4. **Hard final:** verify that the conclusion controls every nonabelian
   composition factor rather than only the socle of a minimal example.

No milestone may move to `complete` from a split-extension scan alone.
